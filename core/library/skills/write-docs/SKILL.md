# Write docs

Document this repository as it is. Match neighboring tone and layout.

## Steps

1. Read the existing README / CONTRIBUTING / comments next to the change.
2. Name the real command, path, or flag. Do not invent a second interface.
3. Prefer a short happy-path example and one common failure.
4. If you cannot run the command, say so.

## Do not

- Describe a future design as if it already shipped.
- Duplicate long code; link the path and show a minimal snippet.
- Rewrite unrelated pages.

## Output

- What changed and where
- The runnable example
- Any command you could not verify
